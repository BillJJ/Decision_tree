# Decision_tree

Classification decision tree written from scratch (well, using pandas).

Currently only have titanic dataset (77% accuracy on test dataset)

to do:
- optimize for big datasets / categorical data (limit classes / unique threshold splits)
- add more example datasets
- make regression tree
