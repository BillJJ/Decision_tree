# Decision_tree

Classification decision tree written from scratch (well, using pandas).
Random forest written in there too

Datasets:
- breast cancer diagnosis
- titanic
- mushroom (100% accuracy, just a bit of overfitting)
- iris

Features:
- can choose either best or random split choices (for each feature: either loop through all unique values, or only some of them, sqrt to be precise)
- can visualize graph now using visualize()

to do:
- ~~optimize for big datasets / categorical data (limit classes / unique threshold splits)~~
- ~~add more example datasets~~
- make regression tree
- ~~make random forest~~
- add example trees for each dataset
